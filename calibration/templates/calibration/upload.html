<h1>Upload calibration pictures</h1>

<p>So you want to use lens correction features of Darktable, Rawstudio,
digiKam, Imagemagick etc, but your <a href="/lensfun_coverage.html">lens is not
yet supported</a>?  No problem – just take some test shots and upload
them here.</p>

<h2>How to upload</h2>

<p>Please select a tarball (.tar.gz) or a ZIP file from your computer that
contains the RAW pictures.  Note that my internet uplink can only handle up to
3 MByte/sec, so the transfer may take a long time.  Your upload may contain
RAWs for many different lenses, but only <em>one</em> camera.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> By uploading files here, you thereby grant
me, <a href="mailto:bronger@physik.rwth-aachen.de">Torsten Bronger</a>, the
right to permanently store them on my computer and use them for generating
calibration data.  This data is then published under the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license</a>.  I will not publish or give away your
images or your email address without your explicit permission.</p>

<h2>What happens after the upload?</h2>

I will send you an email with the calibration data, together with instruction
for how to install them locally.  At the same time, I will send this data to
the LensFun project.  Please give me time for this.  I hope to process every
request within 48 hours but keep in mind that I have to do it partly manually.

<h2>How should test shots look like?</h2>

<p>Test shots need to be taken at a distance of at least 3 metres.  The
pictures must contain one straight line, running from one end of the picture to
the other, very close to the long border of the picture.  Ideally, it contains a
second straight line 1/3 of the image height from the top.</p>

<p>The picture on the left is a good example.  The numbered marks follow the
two lines that I mentioned.  I recommend that you use a modern building and
take pictures of it.  Tilting or rotating the camera is allowed.  Make really
sharp pictures.  Switch off all corrections (some cameras do this even for
RAWs).</p>

<p>If you calibrate a zoom lens, take pictures at at least five different focal
lengths.  Always include the extreme values.</p>

<h2 style="">TCA and vignetting</h2>


<p>The more corrections are possible, the better.  As for TCA (chromatic
aberration), I can maybe use the same pictures that you uploaded for distortion
above.  Anyway, they need to contain sharp high-contrast edges over the whole
image, see the photo on the right.</p>

<p>As for taking pictures for vignetting correction,
see <a href="http://wilson.homeunix.com/lens_calibration_tutorial/#id3">my lens
calibration tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2>About EXIF data …</h2>

<p>I need to know lens model, focal length, and aperture for each shot.
Mostly, this is already included in the RAW.  In case it isn’t, you will be
pointed to a web page where you can add any missing data.</p>

<p>However, if the EXIF data in some files is plain wrong (for example, you
used a fisheye converter), it is necessary that you rename such files.  For
example, you may rename to</p>

<pre>    Canon_EF_24-70mm_f__2.8L_USM--35mm--2.8.CR2</pre>

<p>In the lens name, a single underscore “_” represents a space “ ”, and double
underscore “__” represents a slash “/”.</p>
