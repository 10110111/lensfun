<h1>Upload calibration pictures</h1>


<h2>How to upload</h2>

<p>Please select a tarball (.tar.gz) or a ZIP file from your computer that
contains the RAW pictures.  Note that my internet uplink can only handle up to
3 MByte/sec, so the transfer may take a long time.  Your upload may contain
RAWs for many different lenses, but only <em>one</em> camera.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> By uploading files here, you thereby grant me
  the right to permanently store them on my computer and use them for generating
  calibration data.  This data is then published
 under the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license</a>.  I will not publish or give away your
images or your email address without your explicit permission.</p>

<h2>How should test shots look like?</h2>

<p>Test shots need to be taken at a distance of at least 3 metres.  The
pictures must contain one straight line, running from one end of the picture to
the other, close to the top border of the picture.  Ideally, it contains a
second straight line 1/3 of the image height from the top.</p>

<p>The picture on the left is a good example.  The numbered marks follow the
two lines that I mentioned.  I recommend that you use a modern building and
take pictures of it.  Tilting or rotating the camera is allowed.  Make really
sharp pictures.  Switch off all corrections (some cameras do this even for
RAWs).</p>

<p>If you calibrate a zoom lens, take pictures at at least five different focal
lengths.  Always include the extreme values.</p>

<h2 style="">TCA and vignetting</h2>


<p>The more corrections are possible, the better.  As for TCA (chromatic
aberration), I can maybe use the same pictures that you uploaded for distortion
above.  Anyway, they need to contain sharp high-contrast edges over the whole
image, see the photo on the right.</p>

<p>As for taking pictures for vignetting correction,
see <a href="http://wilson.homeunix.com/lens_calibration_tutorial/#id3">my lens
calibration tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2>About EXIF data …</h2>

<p>I need to know lens model, focal length, and aperture for each shot.
Mostly, this is already included in the RAW.  But sometimes, it isn’t.  Or the
lens data is incorrect because you used a converter etc.  In these cases, you
may include the data into the file name.  For example, you may rename a raw
file to</p>

<pre>    Canon_EF_24-70mm_f__2.8L_USM--35mm--2.8.CR2</pre>

<p>In the lens name, a single underscore “_” represents a space “ ”, and double
underscore “__” represents a slash “/”.</p>

<p>This is, however, only absolutely required if the EXIF data is plain wrong
(converters etc).  Otherwise, you will be pointed to a web page where you can
add any missing data.</p>

<h2>What happens after the upload?</h2>

I will send you an email with the calibration data, together with instruction
for how to install them locally.  At the same time, I will send this data to
the LensFun project.  Please give me time for this.  I hope to process every
request within 48 hours but keep in mind that I have to do it partly manually.
