  "description": "At least in one case the auto-scale that LF reports is wrong: If you want to remap a fisheye image to equirectangular. It still leaves dark corners.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Lensfun scans only the positions of the corders and the edge centres in order to find the proper scaling. This is too few points. I must scan at least 10 points or so per edge.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it scans 5 points per edge, finds the point for which the biggest scaling is necessary, takes the neighbour with the second biggest scaling, and uses a real maximisation algorithm between them to find the optimal scaling.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the routine should also take into account subpixel distortion. Otherwise, only the autoscaling for the green channel is found. However, the red or blue channel may be smaller.",

Since there is no testsuite, I compared the symbols exported from a clang-compiled lib and a GCC-compiled one, and they match.\r\n\r\nPlease include the patch in the next lensfun release.\r\nThis is the original Gentoo bug: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519006\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nFabio Scaccabarozzi",

  "description": "I have the LUMIX G VARIO PZ 14-42/F3.5-5.6, a Micro Four Thirds lens, which I have used with the Panasonic GF2 and GX7.  I use ufraw, which incorporates Lensfun.  About a year ago, I built ufraw from source, because I was having trouble with the version packaged with Fedora.  When I got the GX7, I found that the now-old version of ufraw wasn't working right with it, and I needed to upgrade.  When I did, I started seeing a weird bug: an image which is *mostly* good, but has many pixels set to bright blue, red, or magenta.  By trial and error, I managed to establish that the bug showed up when I used the VARIO PZ lens with the GX7 or the GF2, but not when I used a different lens with either camera, or when I used the VARIO PZ lens with --lensfun=none.  I formed the hypothesis that the bug was in Lensfun, rather than ufraw proper; I tried updating to Lensfun 0.3.0, but the problem persisted.  Instead, I tried dropping back to Lensfun 0.2.7--and the problem went away...but the output of --lensfun=none is identical to that of --lensfun=auto.  Looking at the data directory, I find no entry for the VARIO PZ lens.\r\n\r\nSo...some kind of bug in Lensfun or its data for this lens.  I'm attaching the RAW file and (in a separate comment) the PNG output of 0.2.8.\r\n\r\nMore detail of my trial and error can be found at\r\n\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/ufraw/bugs/393/\r\n\r\nwhich is the bug I originally filed against ufraw, until I realized it wasn't their fault at all.",

According to the configure script it seems like both archives should be extracted into \"./glib-2.0\" but that didn't satisfy the configure script (\"Checking for library glib-2.0 >= 2.0 ...NOT FOUND\"). \r\n\r\nAfter commenting out the glib checks, the configure script ran through but then make failed: \r\n\r\n    C:\\..\\lensfun-0.2.8>make libs\r\n    mkdir out/windows.x86/release\r\n    Syntaxfehler.\r\n    make: *** [out/windows.x86/release] Fehler 1\r\n\r\n...which makes sense as it should be \"mkdir out\\windows.x86\\release\".\r\n\r\nWhen running configure with --target=windows.x86_64 (instead of x86) then \"make libs\" says: \"build/tibs/rules.mak:208: *** Only the X86 architecture is currently supported by the MSVC toolkit!.\" Does this mean I cannot compile for 64 bit? Why not? I am on a 64 bit Windows so it should work.\r\n\r\n",

  "description": "Hi.\r\n\r\nI have a Sony A6000 and a Sigma 19mm 2.8 EX DN lens (the OG model).\r\n\r\nAccording to the LensFun coverage page:\r\n\r\nhttp://wilson.bronger.org/lensfun_coverage.html\r\n\r\n... support is present for the lens.\r\n\r\nUsing darktable 1.6.2 and liblensfun 0.2.8, the camera/lens combo was not recognized at all from the RAW metadata.\r\n\r\nI manually updated to liblensfun 0.3 and camera/lens auto detect would not work. I could manually select the camera/lens combo, though.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the RAW EXIF data shows:\r\n\r\n\"E 19mm F2.8\"\r\n\r\n... as the lens model, but the liblensfun xml file shows:\r\n\r\n\"Sigma 19mm f/2.8 EX DN\"\r\n\r\n... as the lens model.\r\n\r\nRelevant snippet:\r\n    \r\n    <lens>\r\n        <maker>Sigma</maker>\r\n        <model>Sigma 19mm f/2.8 EX DN</model>\r\n        <mount>Sony E</mount>\r\n        <mount>Micro 4/3 System</mount>\r\n        <cropfactor>1.534</cropfactor>\r\n        <calibration>\r\n            <!-- Taken with Sony A6000 -->\r\n            <distortion model=\"poly3\" focal=\"19\" k1=\"-0.00748\" />\r\n            <tca model=\"poly3\" focal=\"19\" br=\"-0.0000466\" vr=\"1.0003817\" bb=\"0.0000346\" vb=\"1.0000194\" />\r\n        </calibration>\r\n    </lens>\r\n    \r\nAnyways, I opened a ticket on darktable redmine, lots more detail there:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.darktable.org/redmine/issues/10331\r\n\r\nThey pretty much told me it's not a darktable bug, so I'm trying my luck here.\r\n\r\nBasically, how can I force detection of the lens model?\r\n\r\nOr is there nothing else to do on LensFun's side?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\nRegards.",

You may ask the exiv2 people to do something about it (e.g. mapping it to something more useful) but if Sony themselves publish a 19mm than this may become ambiguous.  So it may be a limitation that cannot be fixed.\r\n\r\nYou can solve the problem locally on your computer by copying the lensfun entry into an XML file in ~/.local/share/lensfun and changing the lensmodel name in there to \"E 19mm F2.8\".",

It should now set the LENSFUN_XXX paths relative to LENSFUN_INSTALL_PREFIX by default. The LENSFUN_XXX can be overridden manually to select a different absolute path.\r\n\r\nINCLUDE(GNUInstallDirs) will read the GNU standard paths and set CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR. This will override LENSFUN_DATA with an absolute path and is kept till the end.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is currently the smartest solution, but I think it should now work for Torsten and for Bernd.

One could make the \"mm\" in the regex mandatory, but this may break other lens names.\r\n\r\nFor some obscure reason, it does not help to set <focal> and <aperture> explicitly.  This must be changed, or the regexes optimised.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the obove lens is called \"Series One\" in Lensfun's database.  This must be changed to \"Series 1\" once this is fixed.",

However, now (don't ask me when it changed, I just noticed it), MinAperture would be 2.8 and MaxAperture 0.0. Was there any reason for this change? In the docs it says for MaxAperture \"Biggest f-number possible (ex: 22). Can be equal to MinAperture.\" In the header of the lfLens docs it says \"Unknown fields are set to NULL or 0.\" To me this is just plain confusing and feels a bit unpredictable. ",

But additionally, we have this on our long-term to do list, as \"min/max aperture\" itself is confusing.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, we stopped guessing the max aperture from the lens name because too often it was incorrect.  Moreover, we made a distinction between \"only one aperture possible\" and \"max aperture unknown\".  In the first case, it is equal to \"min aperture\". In the latter case, it is zero.\r\n\r\nThe original author himself didn't really know what max aperature should mean: In one place, he defined it as the minimal f-stop number at maximal zoom, and in another place, the maximal possible f-stop number.\r\n\r\nI think on the long run, the aperture should be replaced with \"f-stop-number\", and min/max refer to the global min/max values, no matter at which focal length.  On the short run, the documentation shoule be fixed.",

Maybe you could phrase it the other way around: \"If both MinAperture and MaxAperture have the same value, then the lens is a fixed aperture lens.\" If they are both non-zero and different it is clear that it is not fixed aperture. In the case of MaxAperture 0 you just don't know, could be fixed, could be variable. This phrasing would capture all cases.

In that case, yes, it's not actually a bug.\r\n\r\nBy the way I find it really confusing that <cropfactor> is a direct child of the <lens> element, instead of the <calibration> element. After all, there are two crop factors, the physical minimum for that lens, and the one used for calibration. Or am I misunderstanding something?",

How else would I do that without diving deep into the lensfun API and construct all relevant objects etc. manually? I also used the function for loading a single xml file in my python wrapper for Windows and Mac since I bundle the database files myself in some random place (not \"global\"), so this was the obvious thing to do, but maybe there's a way to tell lensfun where the global db folder is prior to invoking load().

We will then do our best to improve things where we can with our limited time.\r\n\r\nBTW: if you want to add new calibrations data on the fly it is best to create an lfLens object and add the calibration data with the respective functions.

        "text": "Well, the fix to the Win/Mac workaround in my library would be that lfDatabase::Load() supports a database folder path as argument (or similar) since my application will know where the database files are, and I think this is true for any application built for Win/Mac that uses lensfun. This would be far better than me having to scan the directory and load each db file manually.\r\n\r\nI thought about my xml-string-reading and I agree that it makes more sense to create an lfLens object directly. I'll see if I can easily implement that. The xml string was just a very easy way to do it, especially since you could copy paste from the existing xml files. But no, it's not the right way. You're right.",

  "description": "Commit d5d78ff introduced the following bug: When using a PT-based distortion model (PTLens, poly3) with a non-rectilinear lens, the correction into rectilinear does not work anymore.  The reason is that Hugin assumed a wrong focal lenght for the correction, while Lensfun assumes the nominal focal length.  Note that this problem does not occur in presence of a <real-focal-length> tag.\r\n\r\nI don't recommend to revert that commit (unless you need a quick local fix).  I really like keeping Lensfun's core clean, and moving the ugliness into the respective model code.  The long-term fix could be to generate real focal length entries in memory implicitly when reading PT-based distortion entries.  However, I think the source code needs to be refactored a bit before that.\r\n\r\nThus, I leave this bug documented here for the time being.",

  "description": "There are several articles on the web describing how some cameras, for instance, the Sony E and FE mount models (Alpha 7 series, Alpha 5000/6000 series) \r\n* do bake vignetting (\"shading\") compensation into the ARW when enabled on the camera, \r\n* they always bake TCA (lateral chromatic aberration) correction into the ARW (but not the JPG), \r\n* they never bake distortion correction into the ARW.\r\n\r\nI have not yet obtained reasonable test shots for the TCA assessments, but I can confirm the assessment of vignetting and distortion correction.\r\n\r\nAll features are exposed through Sony-specific maker notes in the EXIF though, through these tags (taken from a filtered dump of `exiftool -s -VignettingCorrection -x -LateralChromaticAberration -DistortionCorrectionSetting`:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n0x2011 VignettingCorrection            : Off\r\n0x2012 LateralChromaticAberration      : Auto\r\n0x2013 DistortionCorrectionSetting     : Auto\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n**Vignetting compensation** (shading compensation in Sony's terms) needs to be revisited in (a) the database, (b) the code.\r\n\r\nRegarding (a) the database, I will need to recalculate and resubmit data for four Sony lenses that I have submitted and that currently only compensate for the difference between the camera's limited pre-compensation and full compensation (meaning they are undercorrecting in practice) because the test shots were made with compensation enabled, which runs counter to the instructions.\r\n\r\nFor two more lenses I will also need to obtain data for the limited delta compensation between the in-camera pre-corrected data and the full correction because I will otherwise see over-compensation when applying camera + lensfun, and under-correction when only applying camera compensation.\r\n\r\nRegarding (b) the code, we will need to provide two data sets,\r\n1. one that we have, to be applied when the 0x2011 VignettingCorrection is \"off\";\r\n2. one that we need to build up (I have data for four lenses) to be applied when the 0x2011 EXIF tag VignettingCorrection is \"on\" (2 numerically).\r\n\r\nHow can we extend the database and API so that this alternative set gets accessible to applications such as darktable?",

I edited /usr/share/lensfun/slr-pentax.xml and modified the entry for this lens from:\r\n~~~\r\n<lens>\r\n        <maker>Pentax</maker>\r\n        <model>smc Pentax-DA 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 ED AL IF DC WR</model>\r\n        <model lang=\"en\">smc PENTAX-DA 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 ED AL IF DC WR</model>\r\n        <mount>Pentax K</mount>\r\n        ...\r\n</lens>\r\n~~~\r\nto:\r\n~~~\r\n<lens>\r\n        <maker>Pentax</maker>\r\n        <model>smc Pentax-DA 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 ED AL [IF] DC WR</model>\r\n        <model lang=\"en\">smc PENTAX-DA 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 ED AL IF DC WR</model>\r\n        <mount>Pentax K</mount>\r\n        ...\r\n</lens>\r\n~~~\r\nAnd now the lens detection is correct.",

Lensfun very clearly does use and store lens names internally, so I would appreciate it if you could explicitly answer:\r\n1. Where do lens names come from?\r\n2. Seebk hinted, \"BTW: In general the lens names in the database follow the naming scheme of the exiv2 library\". What does \"in general\" mean, does this vary? When does it vary? What is the fallback?\r\n3. If some lens from Exiv2 has \"F4\" as part of its name, while another has \"f/4\" and yet another has \"F4.0\", do you leave that as-is, or you do normalize that? I'm asking about the stored names, not the lens matching logic.\r\n\r\nThank you",

I stick to the \"f/2.0\" syntax and avoid all-uppercase elements.\r\n\r\nFor non-electronic lenses, I sometimes browse on ebay to find original packaging images with the proper lens names.\r\n\r\nFor Samyang lenses, I use the Samyang name, even it is was sold as Walimex, Rokinon, Optica, or whatever.  This may change a bit since Samyang started to manufacture electronic lenses.\r\n\r\nSo, there are some rules, but it is also a matter of taste and experience.",

        "text": "OK, I try to clarify:\r\nWhen filing this bug I was using a lensfun version based on git `master` branch commit `385aa1` that I installed a couple of days ago. This installed the included xml files to\r\n`/usr/share/lensfun/version_1/<files>`\r\n\r\nWhen running `lensfun-update-data` this morning it correctly recognized version 1 and downloaded `http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/db/version_1.tar.bz2`. This file was then extracted to\r\n`/var/lib/lensfun-updates/version_1/<files>`\r\n\r\nIn these updated files in `/var/lib/...` attribute `real-focal` was moved to its own tag `real-focal-length` which seems to not be understood by lensfun `master` branch (a change that belongs to another version maybe?).\r\n\r\nNext, to verify that my version of lensfun is not too old, I updated my lensfun to latest `master` branch commit `385aa1`. Again included xml files where installed to\r\n`/usr/share/lensfun/version_1/<files>`\r\nwhich lets me assume that version 1 is still the latest for `master`. These files in `/usr/share/...` have still the \"old\" format where `real-focal` is still an attribute of tag `distortion`.\r\n\r\nMy assumption now is that the DB files at `http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/db/version_1.tar.bz2` are created wrongly and contain changes that are not supposed to be in version 1.\r\n\r\nI attached an excerpt from the file `slr-sigma.xml` contained in `http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/db/version_1.tar.bz2` downloaded around 0930 CEST.",

In theory I can build lensfun as DLL with a newer MSVC and then build the Python 2.7 binary extension DLL that links against the DLL with MSVC 2008. However, it would make my workflow/life easier if I could do all in one MSVC version. Also, if at some point I would want to statically link lensfun into the Python binary extension then I would definitely have to use the same compiler, and Python 2.7 requires 2008.

In general, ffmpeg seems to have specific naming conventions and may expect the package configuration file to be named lib/pkgconfig/liblensfun.pc instead of lib/pkgconfig/lensfun.pc to match liblensfun.a in the file name to be linked \u2013 [according to one of the main developers of MABS](https://github.com/jb-alvarado/media-autobuild_suite/issues/899#issuecomment-416402713).\r\n\r\n",

These data were prepared using Andreas Schneider's lens_calibate.py script (after exchanges with Andreas over bugs in script related to colorspaces, which are now sorted) using overcast sky (its UK!) and diffuser.  The data have been tested on a range of shots (particularly blue skies) and seen to be good,  i.e. no over obvious over-correction.  Focus distance changes are quite small, but anyway the data are there.  Tests indicate that the diffuser was behaving ideally and not introducing any vignetting itself, i.e transmission through diffuser was fairly constant across the sensor.\r\n\r\nJim",

I agree that it is best not to over correct.\r\n\r\nOn the Oly 60mm I haven't previously bothered with correction either.  It\r\nis only really any sort of issue at full aperture.

        "text": "Focus distance is very much a factor for the modern internal-focus lenses I've used (all Micro 4/3, so compactness of design could play a part, I suppose). I wouldn't expect it to be a *major* factor until the distances were smaller than the ones in those pictures, but I think it probably depends on the specific lens in question, and might be hard to make general predictions about (strangest case I've seen so far is [this one](https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun/issues/466)).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I feel somewhat differently than Torsten Bronger about the wisdom of only profiling lenses at infinity. For unit-focusing lenses this is probably good enough, but for lenses with moving elements I think it's a bad idea, because over-correction at closer distances seems likely, and it looks much worse than under-correction. The concern is that making the profiling too complicated will prevent people from doing it, but I think people willing to do it at all are probably looking for good results, so... I don't know what the best compromise is.\r\n\r\nI would say that if you only want to profile at one focus distance, then it should be the distance that produces *the least vignetting*, so that it errs on the side of under- rather than over-correction for the rest of the range. Indeed, much in-camera correction seems like it may use this approach, as most images only have partial correction... this may also be an esthetic choice; absolute correction isn't always what people want to see, unless they're stitching panoramas. Of course, determining this distance might end up not being less work that just taking calibration shots at multiple distances... but given that there are still many cameras around that don't produce reliable distance info in EXIF, this may still be the best general, all-around approach.",

        "text": "This doesn't surprise me. The images used for calibration should always look well-corrected - the correction model itself does a really good job with normal, radial light fall-off (it doesn't correct *color* vignetting, though, so that may be apparent even in the calibration images). The problem is that it's hard to produce really good, evenly illuminated calibration images. The diffuser-directly-on-lens method is easy, but my experience is that, for wider lenses, it actually fails for some reason (by increasing apparent vignetting and producing over-correction on real-world images). There's some discussion about that [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/lensfun/mailman/message/35538673/).",
